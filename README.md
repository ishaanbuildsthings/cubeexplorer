### Running the server
All commands should be run from the project root directory.  
1. Create the virtual env with
  ```python3 -m venv env```
2. Start the virtual env with
  ```source env/bin/activate```
(To deactivate the virtual env, use `deactivate`)
3. Install dependencies with
  ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```
4. Start the server with
  ```python3 app.py```

For subsequent runs, you can skip steps 1-3 if there are no changes to the dependencies.
